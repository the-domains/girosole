            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wild Shape-Shifting Sofa Can Be Whatever You Want It to Be</h1><p>Carlo Ratti, who founded MIT's forward-thinking Senseable City Lab, has designed a sofa called Lift-Bit. It is on display at La Triennale in Milan, where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design fair. Sofas (and chairs, for that matter) at Salone del Mobile are like fish in an aquarium: plentiful and beautiful, but, after a while, hard to discern.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/878c309bc4bb2576485cf628acdf5521363f1166.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Great Barrier Reef's Best Hope Is a Killer Robot</h1><p>Crown-of-thorns starfish are the zombies of the sea. They won't die even if you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df2ff642b24f92833cf4da9277a687034f647587.jpg"></article>]]></description>
